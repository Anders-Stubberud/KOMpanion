## KOMpanion

The idea here is to turn KOMpanion into a SaaS utilizing the Strava API in order to list segments by achievability.
The plan is to do this by providing a percentage of difficulty to segments by comparing the actual/estimated wattage of the duration of the segment to the correlating duration in a power curve, such as the one provided by [cycling analytics](https://www.cyclinganalytics.com/blog/2018/06/how-does-your-cycling-power-output-compare).
